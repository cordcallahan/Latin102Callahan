**C. Translation**

Hercules hosted king Dexamenus and daughter Deianira because he wanted to take her virginity and marry her.
When Hercules went missing, Eurytion the centar asks Deianira to be his wife.
Because her father was afraid of the centaur, he promised he would give her away in marriage.
At that time, the centaur came with his brothers to the wedding. 
Hercules intervened, killed the centar and took Deianira.
