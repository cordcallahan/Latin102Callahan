Moriens



C translation

Deianira, wife of Hercules, could not cross the big river, whose name was Evenus, and asked the centaur Nessus, who was the son of Ixion and Nubes, for help. When Deianira was being taken through the river, Nessus wanted to rape her. When Hercules came to the river and Deianira begged for his help, he pierced Nessus with arrows. As Nessus was dying, since he knew that the arrows had great power, he gave his blood to Deienira and said that it was a love potion.
